CastleFortify
=============

Save and Share your Castle Doctrine designs. Also, designs are saved in simple JSON code, so they can be used in any of your own apps.

Here's a map I often use:

Thanks for checking it out, and let me know if you have any ideas on how to make it better!

# Install

1. Edit config.php with proper database connection info
2. Import sql into database (/sql/castle_fortify.sql)

# Future

- house cost/value calculator (via Nystical)
- API for uploading and downloading map code, so you can hook your app into CastleFortify
- Some way to browse screenshots of all the puzzles (maybe a separate web app)
- Some way to give feedback and suggest ideas

# Proposed Ideas

- Floor graphic instead of black (plus floor graphic behind every image
- Walls link together like in the game
- Notes to point out the significance of certain structures
- Login and see all the designs you've looked at
- Description / title / date found
